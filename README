TO DO:
    - do a better way to read the JSON file 
        filereader?
        does react have support?
    
    - override checkboxes to make them reddish color https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_css_custom_checkbox

    - add search box to roles 
    - change implementation of checkbox status from array of true/false to array of the ones that are 
    checked 
    - associated products needs to be easier to parse
    - stop having roles just copy and pasted in there 
    - name of the roles doesnt have to be passed in as a prop to rolesfilter 
        

NOTES:
    npm run dev
